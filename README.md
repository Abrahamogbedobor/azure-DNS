<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Active Directory running in Azure on a Virtual Machine (DC_1)
- A client machine running in Azure on a virtual machine (Client_1) and joined to the domain

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Window Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Inspecting DNS A-records on a server (Hostname to IP address mappings)
- Creating new A-records on server (DC_1) and then observe them from the client machine
- Deleting records from server and then inspect/clear client machine DNS cache in order to gain understanding 
- CNAME records (Mapping one hostname to another hostname)
- Root hints
